# Hollywood_Movies_Analysis 2007 - 2011


Welcome to the "Hollywood Movies Data Analysis 2007-2017" project repository! In this project, we dive into the world of Hollywood movies and explore trends and insights from a dataset spanning the years 2007 to 2011.

Key Business Questions (KBQ)

The analysis is driven by a set of Key Business Questions (KBQ) that guide our exploration:

1. **KBQ 1**: Find the average rotten tomatoes ratings of each genre.
2. **KBQ 2**: The Number of movies produced per year
3. **KBQ 3**: The audience score for each film
4. **KBQ 4**: The profitability per studio
5. **KBQ 5**: The worldwide gross per genre

Data Cleaning Process

The dataset used for this analysis was first cleaned using R. I applied various data cleaning techniques to ensure that the data is accurate and ready for analysis. The process included:

- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Standardizing data formats
- Dealing with outliers
- Data transformation as necessary

The cleaned dataset served as the foundation for my subsequent data analysis.
